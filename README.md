# CS146: Computational Statistics

This folder includes five assignments submitted during the course CS146: Modern Computational Statistics, at Minerva Schools at KGI.

In [Call Center Data Modeling](https://github.com/giovannachaves/CS146-Computational-Statistics/blob/master/Call%20Center%20Data%20Modeling.ipynb) I completa Bayesian data modeling problem for a hypothetical call center's call rate over 24 hours of the day. In [Stan Exercises](https://github.com/giovannachaves/CS146-Computational-Statistics/blob/master/Stan%20Exercises.ipynb), I use PyStan to complete a number of practice modeling exercises. Similarly, [Posterior Predictive Checks](https://github.com/giovannachaves/CS146-Computational-Statistics/blob/master/Posterior%20Predictive%20Checks.ipynb) contains modeling exercises for posterior predictive tests and similar problems. In [Grocery Prices](https://github.com/giovannachaves/CS146-Computational-Statistics/blob/master/Grocery%20Prices.ipynb), I model the effect of neighborhood and supermarket brands on grocery prices in Buenos Aires and Taipei, using PyStan under a Bayesian statistical framework. Finally, in [Modeling and Predicting CO2 Emissions](https://github.com/giovannachaves/CS146-Computational-Statistics/blob/master/Modeling%20and%20Predicting%20CO2%20Emissions.ipynb), I use a similar approach to model historic atmospheric CO2 data and make predictions.
